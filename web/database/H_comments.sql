-Electric vehicles, because Solar is abundant on Mars and petrol is virtually impossible to come by
-Tunnels for underground Mars colonies, which will shield colonists from the deadly radiation of Mars, this would solve one of the great problems of space colonisation
-SpaceX is a no-brainer, they openly strive to reach and colonize Mars
-Hyperloop would work on Mars. No air pressure difference means zero risk of tube collapse, zero plate tectonics means no risk of quakes wrecking the tube. Imagine underground hyperloops in tunnels connecting major Martian colonies!", 76, 486, "2021-09-21 22:35:42"),

I get your looking for the next evolution of hyper loop. but we need to be focusing on using solar panels and led for current roads. cars will soon be obsolete not to mention driver required cars. so many people die of traffic fatalities each year. Henry Ford once said if I listened to my customers I would have build a faster horse. we need innovation from people like Elon. we need government backing to keep America's innovation in this country and a stay two steps ahead of other super powers that are gaining on us technologically. I wish I had the financial backing to get my startup off the ground. I have so many good ideas but don't know where to begin and don't have the time with my current job. I would love to be a part of these exciting new innovations that will bring society forward. even without a competition like the space race it just goes to show u that there are still amazing Americans who are capable of advancing our infrastructure and improving this country through technology.   Elon if u read this I am a IT senior architecture engineer I have alot of good ideas and would love to offer my suggestions for free maybe consult if possible.  if we just use a series of tubes to float around like futurama we can remove the danger of cars and DUIs all together. think of a better personnel carrier all together, innovate travel from point A to point B. until you can properly teleport everyone out of this simulation think of this personnel carrier just like the internet, a series of tubes. lol", 395, 489, "2022-01-28 19:34:42"),

So you really think they didn't think about topics such as Cars will fall on the gap created when the platform goes down where you can just *fucking put a damn gate so they won't*, the underground highway which is literally *THEIR MAIN PROJECT* and What if there is an earthquake which is the same for damn METRO?! 
Get your shit together idiots. Think before you talk.
